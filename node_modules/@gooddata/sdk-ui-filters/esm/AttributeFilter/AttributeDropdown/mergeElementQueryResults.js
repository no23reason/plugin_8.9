         * do NOT rewrite this to splice or concat!
         * for large arrays this will cause a stack size limit breach
         *
         * Illustration:
         * Say we have an attribute with 250 000 elements. We have the range (0;500) loaded and then we request
         * the range (240 000; 240 500). This means we need to fill a hole 239 500 items big.
         * If we do that like
         *
         * mergedItems.splice(currentLength, holeLength, ...new Array(holeLength).fill({ ...emptyListItem }));
         *
         * then since that gets translated roughly to
         *
         * mergedItems.splice.apply(mergedItems, currentLength, holeLength, new Array(holeLength).fill({ ...emptyListItem }));
         *
         * it effectively calls the splice function with 239 503 arguments. Each argument has to be placed on
         * the stack as it is a part of the call frame and even though these are pointers, the sheer number of them
         * is more than enough to hit the stack size limit.
         *
         * Fun fact: Chrome and Safari report this as
         * > RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
         * which is technically true, but not as helpful as Firefox's
         * > RangeError: too many arguments provided for a function call
         *
         * So instead, we "fill the hole" one element at the time which does not put any unreasonable pressure on the stack
         * and should be comparable performance-wise.

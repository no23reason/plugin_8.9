 * This class holds the underlying implementation of data access methods. The code is designed to follow
 * lazy initialization principles. The various data structures (slices, series, their descriptors etc) are
 * only created when needed.
 *
 * The responsibilities of this class is to operate on top of digest & data stored in the data view and
 * from information therein create descriptors for series, slices and then series and slices itself. It also
 * makes access to underlying data transparent - hiding the detail whether series and slices have their
 * data organized in row-\>col or col-\>row.

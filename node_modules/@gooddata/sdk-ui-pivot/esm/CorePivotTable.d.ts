/**
 * This class implements pivot table using the community version of ag-grid.
 *
 * Bear in mind that this is not a typical, standard React component implementation; the main reason
 * behind that is that while ag-grid comes with a React component the ag-grid itself is not a React component
 * and vast majority of its APIs are non-React as well. You will therefore find that there is a lot of non-react
 * state flying around.
 *
 * Instead of looking at this implementation as a typical React component, look at it like a adapter between
 * React and ag-grid which is used to render data obtained using GD executions.
 *
 * The code in this class is built to reflect the adapter nature of the integration. The responsibility of this
 * component is to correctly handle the component lifecycle and orchestrate integration of React and ag-grid, React
 * and GoodData, React and GoodData and ag-grid.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 *
 * The goal of the table is to render data that it obtains from GD platform by driving an execution. To this end
 * the prop 'execution' contains an instance of Prepared Execution which is all set up and ready to run.
 *
 * Before rendering anything, the code must first drive this prepared execution completion in order to figure out
 * how the actual table should look like header-wise.
 *
 * Once the execution completes successfully code will process the result and the metadata included within
 * to construct table headers for ag-grid and prepare an ag-grid data source that the ag-grid will use to read
 * pages of data from backend. Note: while constructing table headers, the code will also apply manual column
 * sizing settings.
 *
 * With this ready, the component can render the actual ag-grid table. It will create ag-grid options with
 * all the necessary metadata and customizations.
 *
 * After the table is successfully rendered, the code may (depending on props) apply grow-to-width and auto-resizing
 * logic on the table columns. And then finally it will determine and set the sticky row contents.
 *
 * At this point when the table is rendered, the users may interact with it and change sorting or add totals
 * or subtotals. All of this is handled outside of React. These changes are handled in the ag-grid data source
 * implementation. As it discovers that different sorts or totals are needed, it will transform the original
 * prepared execution, add the extra settings and re-drive the execution. Once done, it will update the internal
 * state and ping ag-grid API to re-render the table.
 *
 * In case the client changes props (say modifying the prepared execution) the componentDidUpdate will determine
 * whether the full reinitialization is in order. If so the entire existing ag-grid and all our internal state
 * is thrown out and table is initialized from scratch.
 *
 * Notable sub-components
 * ----------------------
 *
 * All custom logic that we build on top of ag-grid has the entry point in `TableFacade`. The code in this component
 * relies on the facade to drive our custom table logic. This facade further delegates complex pieces of work
 * to other components. The most important are `TableDescriptor` and `ResizedColumnStore` + its friends.
 *
 * The `TableDescriptor` is responsible for figuring out how the table should look like and prepare column
 * descriptors and ag-grid ColDefs.
 *
 * The `ResizedColumnStore` & functions in its vicinity are responsible for implementation of our custom
 * table column resizing logic.
 *
 * Apart from these main components there is also our custom implementation of ag-grid data source - this is responsible
 * for getting correct data and transforming it to form that can be consumed by ag-gird. It is the data source where
 * our code has to figure out whether the sorts or totals have changed and if so update the execution to perform
 * the correct execution.
 *
 * Finally there is the sticky row handling which contains some nasty code & at times works with ag-grid internals
 * to get the job done.
 *
 * Control flow
 * ------------
 *
 * To maintain some kind of sanity in this complex component there are two general rules:
 *
 * 1.  TableMethods or its subtypes are the only way how pivot table component passes down its essential functions
 *     to sub-components.
 *
 * 2.  All table functionality and features MUST be orchestrated from the pivot table component itself.
 *     The facade or other subcomponents merely _do the work_ but they do not make 'high level decisions' of
 *     what the table should be doing.
 *
 * These rules are in place to try and get to 'top-down' control flow.
 *
 *
 * Known flaws
 * -----------
 *
 * -  The initial render & subsequent table column resizing is brittle and includes a async functions, timeouts, intervals
 *    etc.
 *
 *    This can be currently knocked out of balance if during initial table render the data source determines
 *    it needs to transform the execution (to include sorts for instance; this was often the case if AD sent execution
 *    definition with invalid sorts).
 *
 * -  The reinitialization of entire table is too aggressive at the moment. There are two most notable cases:
 *
 *    1.  Client changes drills; this will lead to reinit to correctly mark cells as drillable. Perhaps all we
 *        need it to trigger some kind of ag-grid cell refresh?
 *
 *    2.  Client changes prepared execution that comes in props. Any change means reinit. This is not really needed
 *        if only sorts or totals were added but the shape of the table looks the same.
 *
 * Debugging hints
 * ---------------
 *
 * Nothing renders: check out the problem with resizing & data source interplay.

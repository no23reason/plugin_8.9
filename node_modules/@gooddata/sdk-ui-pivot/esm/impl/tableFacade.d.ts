 * This class is a collection of higher-level operations with the table. On top of that the facade keeps track
 * of the state of the data rendered by the table (currentResult, visibleData etc).
 *
 * The facade uses different other sub-modules to get the job done. Most notable are:
 *
 * -  table descriptor
 * -  ag-grid data source
 * -  column resizing store & functions related to it
 * -  sticky row handler and the related ag-grid API Wrapper
 *
 * TODO: This class requires further refactoring. The state maintained by the table is problematic. It needs
 *  to belong to something else. The data related stuff should likely go into the data source and for the
 *  resizing we need some additional higher-level component on top of the resized column store & friends.
